# personal-website-v2

personal-website-v2 is my second take on a personal website where I keep up to date information about myself, my projects and links to other areas of interest. You can view the live version here: [brianrclow.com](https://brianrclow.com)

## Motivation

I wanted to improve my website, add more projects that I have worked on and make a space for people to see me. I am looking for work in the Boise area and thought that updating my website with new information was a good start.
