# personal-website-v2

personal-website-v2 is my second take on a personal website where I kept up to date information about myself, my projects and links to other areas of interest. This version is no longer live, check out the latest version here: [portfolio](https://github.com/brianrclow/portfolio)

## Motivation

I wanted to improve my website, add more projects that I had worked on and make a space for people to see me. I was looking for work in the Boise area and thought that updating my website with new information was a good start.
