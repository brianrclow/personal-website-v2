                <p class="bio-content">I grew up on an avocado ranch in Southern California and moved to Boise to attend college. 
                    I will graduate from Boise State University in December, where I will receive a B.S. in Computer Science, 
                    a minor in Business and a Leadership and Human Relations Certificate. During my time in college, 
                    I found my passion for developing software through finding solutions to community problems.</p>
                <p class="bio-content">I have had professional experiences in technical support, software solutions engineering, 
                    and Human-Computer Interaction Research. These experiences have challenged me in various fields 
                    of Computer Science and have peaked my interst in using mobile and web technologies to help people.</p>
                <p class="bio-content">On a more personal level, I am a fairly active guy who enjoys bike rides, camping trips and 
                    hosting game nights with friends. I am also very interested in leadership and self-development.</p>
                <p class="bio-content">
                    If you'd like to know more about me, don't hesistate to reach out. I'm friendly!</p>
